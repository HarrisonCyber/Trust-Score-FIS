User Trust Scores FIS within Threshold Cryptography  

In the dynamic field of cybersecurity, the combination of fuzzy logic and user trust evaluation highlights itself as an exciting possibility, particularly within the context of threshold cryptography. This report showcases the process taken to produce an intuitive fuzzy inference system, designed to enhance the security frameworks by assessing the nature of a user’s trust. The system utilises
three input variables, Authentication success, policy compliance and regularity of contributions to
assess the complexity of a user’s trust. The output is a trust score, a precise expression of user
reliability, which moves on from the simple yes and no structure of traditional trust assessments.

The initial iteration of the system was designed after an extensive literature review showcasing the
gaps in current systems. This initial design was then put through large amounts of testing to try
and perfect the system membership functions, rule base, and accuracy. The system's final design
presents itself as an adaptable design that suggests its future applications are far beyond what is
explored in this report.

This report not only showcases the effective use of fuzzy logic for trust evaluation but also
anticipates its possible expansion. It positions the system as a foundation for future developments,
wherein fuzzy logic could become key in the complex domain of digital trust management, further
enhancing security in the field of threshold cryptographic and cyber security as a whole.
